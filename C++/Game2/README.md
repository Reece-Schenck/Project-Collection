## Theme/Concept:

The theme to my game is that 2 players (Pitcher and Batter) face off against eachother. 

The pitcher tries to strike out the batter and catch any hit balls. 

The batter tries to score home runs. 

The first playerto 10 points wins!


## Gameplay Loop:

The gameplay loop consists of the pitcher selecting the pitch they want to throw, the pitcher throwing the selected pitch, 
the batter trying to hit the pitch, and finally the pitcher trying to catch any hit balls.


## Goal/Objective:

The goal is simple; Score 10 points before your opponent to win. The batter aim for home runs, and the pitcher aims for strikeouts and catches.
