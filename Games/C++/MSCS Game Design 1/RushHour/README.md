## Theme/Concept:

The theme to my game is that a player is a car racing against traffic and must avoid cars and deer to survive as long as possible while getting the highest score they can.


## Gameplay Loop:

The gameplay loop consists of the player moving left and right to dodge cars (gaining both score and time back), and jumping to avoid deer coming to the players side.


## Goal/Objective:

The goal is simple; survive and get as high of a score as possible through your dodging skills.


## Player Actions:

Stating the Game (Enter Key)

Dodging Left (Left Arrow Key)

Dodging Right (Right Arrow Key)

Jumping (Up Arrow Key)


## Hazards/Threats:

Cars (Will be traveling down at the player each time they move, player must move to the opposite side of the car to dodge it)

Deer (Will periodically travel across the screen, player must jump over the deer to avoid it)
